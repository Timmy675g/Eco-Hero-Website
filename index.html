    <h2>Let's Understand Climate Change Shall We?</h2>
    <p>
      Climate Change refers to long term shifts in rising temperatures and weather patterns. <br> 
      Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. <br>
      But since the 1800s, <b>Human Activities</b> have been the main driver of climate change, 
      primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. <br>
      So it's no surprise that climate change has been an issue since the 1800s.<br>
      An <b>example</b> is in the picture on the right. Climate change causes rising temperatures that melt snow and ice in the glacier.

            <div class="question">1. Is Climate Change natural or human made?</div>
            <div class="answer-container">
                <p class="answer">Both. Natural can cause climate changes by Earth's itself changing orbit and volcanic eruptions can cause climate change. Humans also causes climate change through deforestation, burning fossil fuels, and industrial activities, which speed up the process.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">2. What are the main causes of climate change?</div>
            <div class="answer-container">
                <p class="answer">The main causes include burning fossil fuels for electricity and heat, deforestation, industrial activities, transportation emissions, and agricultural practices that release greenhouse gases.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">3. What are the effects of climate change?</div>
            <div class="answer-container">
                <p class="answer">Effects include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, melting glaciers, loss of biodiversity, threats to food security, and displacement of communities in vulnerable regions.</p>

          <div class="answer-container">
            <p class="answer">Climate change can cause increased heat waves, rising temperatures for us, extreme and unpredictable weathers which can destroy natural habitats and air pollution can cause heart problems and cancer.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="question">5. What is Carbon Footprint and what is the effect?</div>
          <div class="answer-container">
            <p class="answer">A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane ( Greenhouse Gas), released into the atmosphere by human activities. <br>
            The effects is rising temperatures, pollution, ecosystem disruption and extreme weather events. </p>
